My name is Terrance Gallaher Jr. I come from a small town outside of Spokane, WA known as Wellpinit. I study Visual Communication Design at Eastern Washington University and I have a minor in art along with a certificate in User Experience Design. I enjoy meeting new people and I am always ready to conquer any challenges presented to me. I'm also a quick study and learning new things comes easy to me.
